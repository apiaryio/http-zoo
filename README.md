# node-hamms

This repository contains a set of tests / specifications to test HTTP clients for various HTTP protocol edge cases.
We are using [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) HTTP client and custom HTTP server (inspired by [hamms](https://github.com/kevinburke/hamms)) so far.

## Installation

1. Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies

## Usage

1. Start the server by running ```npm start``` in the command line:
2. Open new command line tab and run ```npm test``` for Node.js tests
3. Open new browser tab and enter ```http://localhost:3000``` to the address line for browser tests
